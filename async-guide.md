<!-- ASYNCHRONOUS CODE -->

# 3 Ways to work with Async Code:

- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async/Await

# Async Technologies:

- Ajax
- Fetch API
- REST API - yours or external

# Libraries & Other Methods

- Fetch API
- Axios
- SuperAgent
- JQuery
- Node HTTP

<!-- Ajax -->

- Asynchronous Javascript & XML.
- Ajax is NOT a language or framework.
- It's a Set of web technologies to send and receive data from the client and server.
- It Sends & Receive Data Asynchronously
  - done behind the scenes without having to explicitly reload the web page.
- Does not interfere with the current page.
- JSON has replaced XML for the most part.

<!-- Ajax Call == Async Javascript call  -->

1. We make an Ajax call or an asynchronous call.
2. It goes through an Ajax Engine and uses the XML HTTP request object or the AH object(part of the browser).
3. The server then returns the data in JSON format as a response.

- API's sometimes have certain permissions granted to use.
- Core Enabled, which allows for cross domain communication.
  - this means we can make requests to their API even though we're not on the same domain name as they are.

# XML - HTTP Object - XHR Object

- all browsers have this API, it transfers data between client and server or browser and the server.
- It's provided by the browsers javascript environment. HTTP most common.
